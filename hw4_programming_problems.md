# Problem 10.44

The task requires implementing three page replacement algorithms: FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal (OPT). You need to generate a random page-reference string and then apply each algorithm to this string, recording the number of page faults.

## Solution
folder: `page_replacement`

# Problem 11.27

The task requires implementing three disk-scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SCAN, and C-SCAN. You need to generate a random series of 1,000 cylinder requests and service them according to each algorithm, then report the total amount of head movement required by each algorithm.

## Solution
folder: `disk_scheduling`
